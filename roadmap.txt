Roadmap
----------

- Add a visual representation of each building's max amount
- Balance costs
- Change number scaling to better differentiate between big numbers (and take up less room)
- Add prestige mechanic (spawn a new timeline and gain currency that will allow you to buy upgrades that do various things)
- Add the ability to name your own lines (and maybe change color?)
- Add tab with Options
